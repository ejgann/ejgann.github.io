When I was younger, I would often go with my mom to her office whenever she had to do work on the weekends. I would explore and peruse her coworker's work areas, looking at their personal momentos sitting on their desks on hanging from their walls. One coworker had a cartoon illustration showing a crane or heron-like bird that had just captured a frog and had put it into its mouth to eat. The frog, however, was not going without a fight, and the drawing showed the frog, half-way into the bird's throat, comedically reaching back out to grab hold of the bird's throat so he wouldn't be digested. 

I am and have been that frog since beginning my journey at Flatiron.

I started by attending one of the immersive in-person software engineering programs. I worked endlessly on the pre-work and remember not having a clue about what I was supposed to be learning. Thank you to the Learn.co folks for infinite patience and hand-holding during some of my screenshare chats. I'm convinced that whenever I wrote in with a question, people would do paper-scissors-rock or a coin toss method among their colleagues to determine who would field my questions that day. 

To make a long story short....I bombed out of the immersive in-person program after the maximum-allowed two attempts in two different cohorts. I was booted to the online self-paced program through which I continue to work. I was really hard on myself about this fact, too. While it took me a few weeks to recalibrate and mentally get back on the path, I, like that frog in the drawing, was NOT going to give up. It had become personal by this point.

Fast-forward to a few days ago when I was working on a lab involving the Rails' has_many_through relationship. There was literally a moment where I found myself saying aloud "Aha!! I get it!!". It was a concept that I had been struggling to understand ever since beginning the Rails curriculum in the in-person program. Reflecting on this moment, I realize now that ever since I started the self-paced program, things were making a lot more sense because I was able to spend a lot more time fully understanding the nuts and bolts of what I was learning. I was able to figure things out on my own before diving into the online world for solutions.

I certainly have so much more to learn, but witnessing my own personal resolve and determination in action has been incredible since I used to give up on things rather easily. If, like me, you have failed out of the in-person program and have decided to continue in the online self-paced program, I hope you will keep in mind the image of the cartoon illustration involving the frog and the bird and take on a "Not today!" attitude. Here's to the frogs of the world!
